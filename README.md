## [Gaukas Wang](https://github.com/Gaukas), Computer Engineer & Censorship Researcher

### Weird name, isn't it?

People had been asking me the meaning of my name Gaukas for many years. 

<!-- 
Here's what I found 
**Gau-**: Area of fertile agricultural land <br>
**-kas**: Treasurer 
-->

So here's how I get this name: _When I was in my middle school, I got sick one day so I took a day-off. As it is so boring to staying at home alone, I started to play the campaign of a game called **Warcraft 3: Frozen Throne**. To start with I need to create a profile and I randomly typed some mumbo jumbo starting with something like **gaukas**, which sounded like a name. So I kept it as my alias until now._

### Selected Projects
- [SuperLeakage](https://tunnelwork.github.io/SuperLeakage/) - See how much can I leak out of you?
- [TranspoRTC](https://github.com/Gaukas/transportc) - WebRTC, but it is a transport.
- [PlaySync](https://github.com/PlaySync/PlaySync) - Moving to a new Music platform? Or keep both.
