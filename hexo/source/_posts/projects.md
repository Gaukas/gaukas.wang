This page lists some of my academic/personal projects that I am actively working on, have worked on, will be working on, and have completed. 

## Go

### [uTLS](https://github.com/refraction-networking/utls)
Fork of the Go standard TLS library, providing low-level access to the ClientHello for mimicry purposes.

### [seed2sdp](https://github.com/Gaukas/seed2sdp)
An attempt on simplifying the Session Description Protocol (SDP) message generated by [WebRTC](https://webrtc.org/), in order to minimize the data that needs to be exchanged between peers that are establishing WebRTC PeerConnections/DataChannels. 

**seed2sdp** enables a seed-string based WebRTC connection establishment. Eliminating the bidirectional signalling process which was once required.

### [transportc](https://github.com/Gaukas/transportc)
A pluggable transport implemented with WebRTC data channels. 

**transportc** creates `WebRTConn` structs which interfaces `net.Conn` to provide better programmability for easier integration of WebRTC DataChannels. 

### [webauthn](https://github.com/Gaukas/webauthn)
A fork of WebAuthn (FIDO2) server library from [duo-labs/webauthn](https://github.com/duo-labs/webauthn) with improved programmability.

### [passthru](https://github.com/gaukas/passthru)
(De-)multiplexing TCP connections based on DPI-based Application Data sniffing.

## Rust

(to be added)

## Python

### [psrecord_io](https://github.com/Gaukas/psrecord_io)
A fork of [astrofrog/psrecord](https://github.com/astrofrog/psrecord) with I/O stats added.
