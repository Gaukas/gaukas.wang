This page lists some of my academic/personal projects that I am actively working on, have worked on, will be working on, and have completed. 

## Go

### seed2sdp
An attempt on simplifying the Session Description Protocol (SDP) message generated by [WebRTC](https://webrtc.org/), in order to minimize the data that needs to be exchanged between peers that are establishing WebRTC PeerConnections/DataChannels. 

**seed2sdp** enables a seed-string based WebRTC connection establishment. Eliminating the bidirectional signalling process which was once required.

### transportc
A pluggable transport implemented with WebRTC data channels. 

**transportc** creates `WebRTConn` structs which interfaces `net.Conn` to provide better programmability for easier integration of WebRTC DataChannels.
