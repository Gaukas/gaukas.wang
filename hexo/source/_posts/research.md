My research interests span multiple areas, including Censorship Circumvention, Cybersecurity, Network, Privacy. 

## Censorship Circumvention
Censorship is a serious problem in many countries. Since *Uncensored Internet Access is a basic human right*, censorship should be considered as a violation of human rights. 

I still believe censorship is overall harmful no matter which country it is. It discourages people from getting unbiased informations and therefore amplifies the ignorance. In addition, Censorship may make a society more vulnerable to false information by having less exposure to such. 

While governments seek to expand their influence in the cyberspace, it is the responsibility of all netizens to raise awareness of these potential risks brought in by governments from the countries all over the world.

## Cybersecurity 
Cybersecurity is a broad and popular topic. As it indicates, it is a field that studies the security of computer systems. It may not be so far from everyone's daily life as it may sound. Try think about the presidential election in the US, what if the electronic voting system is compromised? 

## Network
Network, especially the Internet, is taking a more and more important role in our daily life. It is a platform that connects people all over the world. It is also a platform that allows people to share their ideas and opinions. 

For people living in the modern society, the Internet is a necessity. One day without Internet is like a day without sunshine.

## Privacy
Privacy violation is a serious problem in the modern society. 

I don't think I need to explain how bad it has been or why should we care about it.
